# Neopets-Scripts
Just a few QoL scripts for Neopets.com. This repository is a WIP, I will add more as I make more.

<h1>Set up:</h1>
These scripts require the <a href="https://www.tampermonkey.net">Tampermonkey</a> browser extension to work. Click the "raw" link in the top left and it will take you to the installation. <BR>

Are you tired of having to open the community tab or navigate to an unconverted page to see who's online? This will update in real time to show you your online friends. Works well with <a href="https://github.com/Blathers">Blather's</a> script which keeps the <a href="https://github.com/Blathers/neopets-user-scripts">sidebar always open</a>
