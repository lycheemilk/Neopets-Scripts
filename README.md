# Neopets-Scripts
Just a few QoL scripts for Neopets.com. This repository is a WIP, I will add more as I make more.

Are you tired of having to open the community tab or navigate to an unconverted page to see who's online? Works well with <a href="https://github.com/Blathers">Blather's</a> script which keeps the <a href="https://github.com/Blathers/neopets-user-scripts">sidebar always open</a>
